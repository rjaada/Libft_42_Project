This project contains a collection of common lbrarian functions implemented from scratch, intended to help you learn C functions.

The files in the project include:

- Function implementations to replace library functions (.g., ft_atoi.c, ft_bzero.c, ft_calloc.c, ft_isalnum.c, etc.)
- Header file libft.h containing function prototypes for all implemented functions.
